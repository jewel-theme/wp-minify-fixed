# wp-minify-fixed
WP Minify fixed is the exact copy of the popular WordPress minification plugin available at WordPress.org plugin repository. But unfortunately the plugin is not maintained for over 2 years and showing many error notices. So I fixed it for further use. Thanks to constantin.boiangiu for the is_feed() fix.
